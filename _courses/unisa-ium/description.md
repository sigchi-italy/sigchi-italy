## Syllabus 

*Knowledge and Understanding:*

The student is expected to gain knowledge on:

- foundations of man-machine interaction
- guidelines and principles to support usability of interactive systems
- common techniques for the analysis of user interfaces with respect to usability and to accessibility
- the design of dialogue and interactive systems in general.

*Ability to apply knowledge and understanding:*

The student is expected to be able to:

- define the steps necessary to design, plan, develop and evaluate user interfaces prototypes with respect to to their use,
- build a model of users of an interactive application, considering different platforms of use, including mobile devices and web browser.

*Prerequisites:*

The course assumes a familiarity with the general concepts of programming language and model of the system. Knowledge of basic concepts of software engineering facilitates the understanding of some aspects.

*Contents:*

- Introduction of the concept of "Human computer interaction"
- Framework and models of interaction. Styles of interaction 
- The social context of interaction
- Notes on ergonomics
- The design of men - system interfaces.
-  Principles of interface design
-  Guidelines and methodologies for the identification of user profiles
-  Task analysis and usage scenarios.
- Interaction paradigms for usability: historical perspective. 
- The paradigm of direct manipulation. 
- The multimodal interaction. 
- The collaborative interaction. 
- Notes on more advanced paradigms of interaction, such as ubiquitous computing, augmented reality and virtual reality.
- Principles supporting usability: "learnability", "flexibility", and "robustness". 
- Accessibility guidelines.
- User interface management systems. 
- The iterative design and prototyping techniques for interactive applications. 
- Paper sketches of user interfaces.
- Techniques for evaluation of interactive systems. Comparison between field assessment and evaluation in the laboratory. Techniques to be applied in the design phase and techniques to be applied upon implementation.

*Teaching Methods:*

Lectures will be delivered in the classroom. The study of the topics will also be realized by means of practical exercises and home assignments, followed by classroom discussions. Educational material suitably prepared will be provided through an e-learning platform. Students are encouraged to attend classes although this is not mandatory in order to take the final exam.

- A. DIX, J. FINLAY, G. ABOWD, R. BEALE, “INTERAZIONE UOMO MACCHINA”, MCGRAW-HILL

## Verification of learning
Each student will take part in a group project, which will be used to assess the practical skills acquired. The indivual assessment will be based on:
1) a one-hour written test designed to verify the theoretical knowledge acquired
2) an oral exam, which will include the discussion of the project, with the goal to verify if the student has gain the capability to design, plan, develop and evaluate usable interfaces, also thanks to appropriate user modeling in a given context of use.

Students attending the classes will be allowed to take a written in-course exam before the end of the course. Those who pass the in-course exam will be exempted from the final written test.

The written and the oral tests will contribute to the final evaluation with a weight of approximately 40% and 60% respectively.
