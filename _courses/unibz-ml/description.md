## Syllabus 
https://webservices.scientificnet.org/rest/uisdata/api/v1/coursedescriptions/74222

## Teaching Materials 
Students need to come to the course and exam with their own laptops.

Furthermore, the course and hence the exam make use of physical computing toolkits. Each toolkit contains:
(1) 1 Raspberry Pi, either Model 3 B, or 3 B+, or 4, with 1 SD card and Raspbian,
(2) 1 Sense-Hat,
(3) 1 Explorer-Hat,
(4) 1 starter microelectronics kit for Raspberry Pi, with 1 breadboard, 1 T-cobbler, 1 PIR motion sensor, various jumper wires, LEDs, buttons, resistors (e.g., see a basic starter kit example and PIR motion sensors).

The course toolkits are prepared in advance by teachers and made available for free but only during class and exam hours to on-site attendees, i.e., on-site attendance is necessary for using the course toolkits. 

The required operating system and libraries are prepared in advanced by teachers as well and made available via github to enrolled students. 

## Tools Addressed in the Course 
Raspberry PI tools, VNC on students' laptobs (mandatory), Tynkercad for circuits and 3D fabrication (optional) 

## Additional information 
The course offers the basics of interaction design with physical computing. Every year a different design context is explored, e.g., outdoors, school. Teachers choose and prepare sensors and actuators for the context. Then the course starts by making students familiar with the basics of programmable microelectronics, without assuming that students are familiar with circuits but assuming that they have already got a working programming knowledge. Scaffolding exercises guide students to learn how to program the Raspberry Pi board with circuits with the chosen sensors and actuators and ad-hoc hats, all prepared by teachers. In the middle of the course a hackaton in organised in relation to the chosen context. External experts are invited to pose challenges related to the context. Students are given design toolkits for rapidly conceptualising a physical-computing solution for a challenge, by mashing-up exercises tackled during the course or further programs that students find on their own. During the remaining part of the course students rapidly develop their mash-up solutions and, optionally, can fabricate it thanks to the Fablab of unibz with which the course has an agreement.
