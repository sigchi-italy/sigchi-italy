## Syllabus 
• "Future visions": to imagine and communicate the next future.
•  Examples of innovations and the description of the operational context.
•  Humans and machines: basic theoretical aspects and human communication; the machine and its evolution; the machine-mediated communication; the transformation of the framework of reference (industrial, post-industrial, organic era of the interaction).
•  A design vision to go beyond the traditional HCI: "person in place centered design”, "design for the experience” and “design for wellbeing".
•  The process as object of innovation: the IT point of view; the designer's point of view; industrial processes; the organic process; reflections on the innovation and its characteristics.
•  The methodological framework of reference and its use in design processes.
•  Getting aware about the human: traditional ergonomics, human factors and beyond; sense and actuate, attentional processes and workload, memory; mental models, feedback, affordances (invitations, constraints and mapping); emotion and social interaction.
•  The project of the evaluation: known and useful models, predictions and verifications, task analysis, heuristics, qualitative investigations, monitoring of traces, emergent properties, indicators and indices.
• The "problem" of the design: the dichotomous nature of the design. The example of industrial design between inventions, cultural driving forces and technological evolutions.
• Rapid prototyping: low, medium and high fidelity prototyping, rapid software prototyping (hints), sensors and rapid electronic prototyping, rapid mechanical prototyping.
• UML language

## Teaching Materials 
Teachers’ slides and recorded videos

## Tools Addressed in the Course 
Many depending on the specific phase of the process: In the background Mirò and Google suite for collaboration. Teams or other videoconf environment for virtual meetings. LIFE as e-learning environment. Media elaboration tools (non addressed in the course but used). Balsamiq for rapid “paper” prototyping, Arduino for electronic prototyping, Processing for desktop prototyping, Figma or other softwares for mobile prototyping (only free versions), Wordpress for website prototyping, Cura for 3D mechanical prototyping. Etc. 

## Additional information 
LEARNING OUTCOMES:

•  capability to carry out a process of technological innovation within any working environment: starting with the study of the context and the identification of problems/needs till the realization of prototypes and the communication of the innovation;
•  acquisition of advanced working methods;
•  capability to integrate knowledges, skills and competences developed in previous years and courses within an interdisciplinary process aimed at creating a concreate outcome;
•  development of transversal skills to reduce the student's skill-gap with respect to the demands of potential employers
•  development of meta-design skills

KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING: 

Become familiar with all key issues and concepts related to innovation processes that make use and are mediated by technologies.
Get aware of all phases that characterize the processes and of the transformations that the processes have undergone over time. Get in contact with  methodologies and technologies needed to implement the process. 
Get aware of the evolution of the machine, of its role as mediator and of the problems related to the evolution of a human-machine interaction as basis of a people centered design for the experience. Get aware of the 3D+1 model of the experience. Get aware of most popular methods to monitor and evaluate the human-machine/system interaction and the experience. 
Get familiar with rapid prototyping methods,  the basics of UML and the methods to communicate the innovation.

APPLYING KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING:

Upon completion of the course, students should be able to
•  set up, plan and manage a person-centered innovation process that includes at least: the analysis of a context with the identification of problems/needs (problem setting), the ideation of solutions (divergent problem solving), the choice of the best solution (convergent problem solving), project blueprint (with UML diagrams), look & feel development, the design of the interaction, the prototype realization, the design and exploitation of test scenarios, the narration of the innovation process
•  use of basic methodologies for carrying out the various phases of the process (eg. Gantt diagram, questionnaires, websearch, brainstorming, focus groups, production of maps and boards of the domain, benchmarking tables, SWOT analysis, storytelling, use of techniques and tools to develop GUI, use techniques and tools to produce low-medium-high fidelity rapid prototypes, monitoring and evaluation techniques, etc.)

MAKING JUDGEMENTS: 

At the end of the course, the students will achieve autonomy of judgment if they will be able to critically choose:
•  the type of design process best suited to the case study
•  the most suitable methodologies for carrying out the various phases of the process
•  the most viable and effective solutions to identified problems/needs
•  the technologies most suitable for the development of the identified solution
•  the most suitable approaches to monitor and evaluate the human-machine/system interaction and to measure the impact of the project
•  the communication methods best suited to the target of reference.
In summary: if they will be able to set up and manage independently an innovation process.

COMMUNICATION SKILLS:

During the development of the course the students will learn to communicate by mean of:
- graphic representations of research and analysis outcomes (infographics)
- storytelling of problem setting & solving (e.g. video storytelling)
- pitch targetted to potential stakeholders
- manuals targetted to users and developers
- scientific report/articles.

LEARNING SKILLS:

During the course the students will learn to compare processes, methodologies and technologies of various kinds and purposes, and to refine their research skills and critical judgment in order to increase progressively their own toolbox and meta-design skills.

-----

Non-mandatory prerequisites
- basics of procedural and object-oriented programming;
- basics of web programming (client-server applications)
- databases
- media processing (images and videos)
Basic knowledge of mathematics, physics and statistics. 

------

Delivery modality
Lectures (open to the discussion) to become familiar with the basic theoretical aspects and operational frameworks of reference.
Lectures can be held in F2F, on-line or in a parallel blended configuration.
Development of an innovation process on a free chosen theme (from context exploration and problem setting to the prototyping and the communication of the innovation).
The development of the innovation process will make use of collaborative environments availble in cloud and a design diary (to be open in the LIFE environment) with reviews conducted F2F or on-line.
