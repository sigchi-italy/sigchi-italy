    Information Visualization(IV): Information Visualization (IV): definitions. Data vs. Information. Goals of IV. Information Visualization vs. Scientific Visualization. Issues involved in IV Design. Mapping: principles, visual attributes. Mapping examples. 2D vs. 3D visualizations. Typical IV design problems. A classification of data types: Categorical, Numerical, Topological, Symbolic, Textual Data.
    Techniques for visualizing and interacting with data: Bivariate, Trivariate, Multivariate data: Scatterplots, Mosaic Display, Parallel coordinate plots, Starplot, Chernoff Faces. Hierarchical Axis. Dimensional Stacking. A general model for information visualization systems. A classification of task types: overview, zoom, filter, details-on-demand, relate, history, extract. Dynamic Queries, Alphasliders, The Attribute Explorer. InfoZoom. Demonstration of XMDV software. Pixel-oriented visualizations: screen-filling curves, recursive pattern, circle segments.
    The presentation problem: Overview+Detail techniques. Focus+Context techniques. Distortion-oriented techniques. Table Lens. Perspective Wall. Fish-eye view. An alternative classification of data types: 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, temporal, multi-dimensional, tree, network. Trees: Treemaps, Cone Trees, Camtrees, Star Tree, Hyperbolic Trees. Networks: SeeNet, HierNet, NetMap. Demonstration of Many Eyes software. Temporal data: Lifelines, AsbruView, Paint Strips. Documents: TileBars, document Galaxies, Themescape, Citeseer-Relator, MDS-interactive.
    Case study: IV in Medicine: Visualizing medical data: medical imaging vs. IV. Demonstration of a DICOM interactive visualizer. A gallery of medical IV examples: Interactive Data Exploration of clinical databases, Digital libraries of anatomical images. Visual data mining of Hemodialysis data.
