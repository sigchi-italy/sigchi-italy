## Syllabus 
Module 1, M1: https://webservices.scientificnet.org/rest/uisdata/api/v1/coursedescriptions/74793 
Module 2, M2: https://webservices.scientificnet.org/rest/uisdata/api/v1/coursedescriptions/75379

## Teaching Materials 
All material of the course is organised in classes in Teams so as to facilitated self-study as best as possible. Classes and their material are of type: (1) frontal lectures with notebooks containing interactive exercises; (2) laboratories with challenges (e.g., quizzes or programming problems); (3) workshops with mash-up projects. 

## Tools Addressed in the Course 
Python for natural-language-based interactions, e.g., nltk and speech librarires

## Additional information 
The course is meant for students without computer-science background but a theoretical background in linguistics. The course material is thus prepared by considering this cohort of students. The mash-up projects of M2 leverage on the programming exercises student tackle in M1. At the end of the course, students need to be able to conceptualise and program a solution for interacting with personas in natural language. The nltk package is used besides other for speech-based interactions.
