## Syllabus 
Acquisition of concrete skills in the Interaction Design (ID) development process for multimedia and multimodal interfaces: how to manage the development process (iterative, user-centered, participatory design); usability, user experience, and evaluation in HCI/ID. Basic introductory knowledge on the design of emotional and social interfaces, and on sound and music computing. Courseworks devoted to the realization of the development process of a concrete interaction design project of an interactive product during the whole semester, concluding in a simulation of a startup contest in collaboration with Wylab startup incubator (wylab.net). Courseworks focus on the management of a successful development process of an interface, on the evaluation process of the quality of an interface. The focus of courseworks is on Creative and Cultural Sectors (CCSs), and in particular on applications involving non-verbal and full-body interaction in joint actions, social interfaces, persuasive technologies and behavioural change, detecting emotions and emotional technology. 

## Teaching Materials 
course slides; scientific papers and other materials; Preece/Rogers/Sharp Interaction Design 5th Ed.

## Tools Addressed in the Course 
tools available at Casa Paganini-InfoMus res.centre, incl. Qualisys motion capture, interfaces, various sensors, and multichannel audio.
