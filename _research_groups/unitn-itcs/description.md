### Main Research Interests
Nowadays, the digital revolution is drastically changing our lives, yet the possibilities offered by the technological progress are too often driven by mere technological opportunities rather than thoughtful consideration of what human beings really need to improve quality of life. We believe that design of digital technologies should start and finish by considering the cognitive, social and ethical aspects of human beings as part of social communities.
The activities organized by the lab are grounded in the teaching for the bachelor degree (laurea triennale) Interfacce e Tecnologie della Comunicazione (offered in Italian), for the master degree (laurea magistrale) Human-Computer Interaction (offered in English) as well as on the research work of Phd students.
IT&CS is a joint laboratory with the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) and in particular the the i3 research unit of the Center for Digital Society.
