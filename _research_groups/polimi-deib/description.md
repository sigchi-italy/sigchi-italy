## Main Research Interests
The Human-Centric Web Engineering(HCWE) group is part of the TIS (Technologies for Information Systems) lab. Its research focuses on aspects at the intersection of Web Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction. The emphasis is on exploiting novel and advanced Web/mobile/IoT technologies to enable the creation of advanced interactive systems. The main covered aspects relate to: techniques and tools for the composition of interactive applications on the Web (by means of Web Mashup technologies); design and rapid prototyping of conversational agents for data exploration; design paradigms, visual notations and tools  for the end-user development (by domain experts) of smart interactive experiences and smart environments. A recent activity, which aims  to motivate children to explore nature and play outdoor, also focuses on co-design methods for children to make them protagonists in the design of smart nature ecosystems.
