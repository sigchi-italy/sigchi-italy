## Main Research Interests
The research interests revolve around how people make sense of their personal data collected through self-tracking technologies, as well as how we can motivate and engage individuals by using design techniques coming from the world of video games. In doing so, we explore the opportunities offered by the ethnographic methods for understanding the impacts of technology in situated practices. Recently, we started researching systems for changing behavior, and design techniques to support critical reflection on the long-term impacts of technology.
