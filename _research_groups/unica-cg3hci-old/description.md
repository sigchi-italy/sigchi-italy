### Main Research Interests
The CG3HCI group merges research experience in both Computer Graphics and Human Computer Interaction. The main research interest in HCI are the following:
1) Gestural Interaction. The lab is currently working on methods for combining declarative and compositional gesture descriptions with highly accurate classification techniques.
2) Intelligent User Interfaces. We are currently focusing on the interpretability, explainability and control of Artificial Intelligence system components for the end users. 
3) Augmented and Virtual Reality: We work on the engineering and the design of content editing techniques for end-users.
4) End User Development: We develop technique for supporting users without programming knowledge in creating web-based automated processes and video-games
5) New Technologies in Education: We investigate techniques for using AR, MR and videogames for teaching purposes.
