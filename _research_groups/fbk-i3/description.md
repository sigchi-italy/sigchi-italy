### Main Research Interests
i3 - Intelligent Interfaces and Interaction is a research group in  human-computer interaction at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK). The focus is on using a highly interdisciplinary approach borrowed from cognitive and social sciences for the design of interaction modalities for digital technologies. The research objectives are at the same time technological—that is, developing innovative technologies—and social—that is, investigating how people use and benefit from these technologies.The emphasis is to investigate interactive experiences aimed at improving the quality of human interactions mediated by computers.
