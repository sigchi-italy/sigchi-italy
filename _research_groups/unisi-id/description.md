### Main Research Interests
The Interaction Design Laboratory of the University of Siena (IxD-UNISI) has been involved in research and development activities related to digital technologies for over 30 years. In this field it has been constantly involved in project activities financed by private (among others, Apple, Philips, Domus Academy, EuroControl, Ferrovie dello Stato, Simens, Indesit, DeAgostini, MPS, Franke, SECO) and public bodies (Miur, European Commission, European Science Foundation). 
In these projects the Laboratory, thanks to its multidisciplinary skills, has carried out, in various combinations, the following activities: A) User Requirements and Business Canvas Models generation, B) Production and processing of Design Concepts, C) Production of hardware and software prototypes, D) Generation of solutions based on Machine Learning algorithms, E) Heuristic and experimental evaluation of design solutions with stakeholders and end users. 
IxD-UNISI has expertise in System and Service Design based on Machine Learning based solutions. The most recent products  include: i) An ATM attack detection system based on Deep Learning. A system for quality control along production lines based on Convolutional Networks. 
The working methodology is based on Human-Centred Design methods and Design Thinking mindsets.
