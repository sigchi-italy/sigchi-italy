## Main Research Interests
The Interaction, Visualization, Usability & UX Lab is coordinated by Prof. M. F. Costabile. The IVU members have years of experience on Usability and UX, on End-User Development and on Information Visualization and Visual Analytics (VA). VA is of particular interest in Data Science, since it integrates Artificial Intelligence techniques with interactive visualizations that provide analysts with further knowledge on the data and allow them to control the analysis process.
Recent research interests are on Usable Security: methods to create user interfaces that consider security and privacy are investigated in order to limit system vulnerability due to non appropriate user actions.
On these topics, people working in IVU have national and international collaborations, as indicated by the various projects in which they were involved and by their publications. Application domains of current research include Cultural Heritage, Ambient Assisted Living, Home automation, Smart Cities.
